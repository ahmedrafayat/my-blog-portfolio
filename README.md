# Let's cut to the chase

If the name wasn't obvious enough, this repo contains my personal website. It's written in gatsby and I forked it off of [this guy right here](https://github.com/panr/gatsby-starter-hello-friend)

TO DO:

- Deploy to github pages
- Good picture in portfolio.md
- Minutes to read
- Make the blog dynamic
